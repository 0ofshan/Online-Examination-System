📘 Online Examination System – SQL Project
This project showcases a fully structured Online Examination System built using SQL. It focuses on efficient data handling, exam management, student performance tracking, and analytical result generation.
All database components, students, subjects, exams, questions, answers, and results, are connected through a clean relational model that ensures accuracy, integrity, and smooth operations.

🗄️ Database Structure
This project includes the following relational tables:
•	Students – Student details (ID, name, email, class)
•	Subjects – Academic subjects offered
•	Exams – Exam schedule with subject & duration
•	Questions – MCQs linked to specific exams

🧩 SQL Concepts Demonstrated
This project includes strong coverage of intermediate SQL topics:
1️⃣ Subqueries
Examples include:
•	Students who never scored grade A
•	Exams where the average score is above a threshold
•	Students who submitted at least one incorrect answer

2️⃣ Joins
•	Student marks with subject names
•	Student responses with question text
•	Subject-wise average performance

3️⃣ Views
Reusable analytics:
•	Top_Performers View
•	Student_Report View

Presentation1
These views simplify reporting and allow instant insights.
